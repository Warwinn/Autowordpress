The Amazonian Cultural Complex also includes indigenous concepts, some of which were elaborated through other group cultures, but some of which arose independently in individual communities. Examples of such group concepts include kinship, spirit possession, and the management of goods and resources (Manous 1992). Amazonian peoples also have their own culturally based concepts of the sacred, for example, their own types of shamanism, which is located in their cosmos, their biosphere, and their bodies. There is no one, commonly accepted, generally recognized \u201cAmazonian spirituality.\u201d Amazonian spirituality (or the Amazonian Spiritual Complex) is a complex phenomenon in which a wide variety of indigenous cosmologies, cosmogonies, modes of healing, and forms of knowledge are articulated, organized, and expressed in ritual and other social activities. This range of spiritual modes and practices is not universal or universalizable. It is a characteristic of what Manous calls the Amazonian Cultural Complex. Nevertheless, there are several kinds of spiritual traditions common to most if not all of the Amazonian peoples, even if not all people are religious practitioners of these traditions. To borrow a phrase from my colleague, Daniel Seixas, these are \u201cshared structures of the cosmos\u201d (2014, 115) that \u201cdefine the basic existential and cultural parameters of indigenous life\u201d (2012, 12). Such traditions include, among other things, cosmologies, cosmogonies, healing and medicinal practices, beliefs about death and the afterlife, forms of morality and ethics, forms of divination and prophecy, conceptions of the sacred, and forms of ritual, ceremony, feasting, and other public expression. The major goal of this book is to excavate, decode, and demystify some of the sources of this spiritual material, that is, to recover and to make accessible to Western and non-Amazonian audiences the meanings of this material to Amazonian peoples. This is a long-term project, and it has meant a great deal of fieldwork and many years of effort, both in Latin America and in the United States.

The purpose of this investigation was to measure the proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) on a series of commercially available implant surfaces and materials as a function of time in order to evaluate these cell responses. Highly polished metal surfaces from 14 implant materials and silicone abutments were placed in contact with HGFs cultured in vitro.

The tissues were examined for cellular attachment, spread, proliferation, and long-term retention. In addition, in vivo experimentation of peri-implant soft tissues was performed using a Bio-Mimetic Implant in which human HGFs were seeded on machined titanium. This model allowed a test of the titanium material's biocompatibility and the formation of peri-implant soft tissues. HGFs were grown on metal surfaces to compare their proliferation responses to titanium versus oral implants, and a study was performed to compare their responses to titanium with those to a cobalt-chromium implant. Implant-derived materials are pro-inflammatory, while titanium is pro-osteogenic. HGFs that were grown on machined titanium were pro-osteogenic, whereas HGFs that were grown on the other surfaces were only partially responsive to the implant conditions.

The more you move the hurricanes' origin (ocean surface) towards their point of landfall (land surface), the higher the storm will rise and the longer it will stay aloft (several weeks in the case of Hurricane Katrina). The closer you get to their landfall, the faster they rise and the shorter they stay in the air. This is why hurricanes are stronger at sea and weaker on land.

If you start with an exact circle, then all the winds pointing into the circle are going into the center, so it doesn't matter which direction you face as long as the winds keep pointing into the center. An easier example: If you imagine your head is pointing directly south, your arms are pointing east, and your legs are pointing west, there's a wind that's blowing into you from the south, and then a second wind that is blowing into you from the east.

We want to be right and think we have the answer to life. When someone else is saying we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, and we\u2019re just convinced that the only possible outcome is that we fail, it\u2019s frustrating to hear that. We want to get it wrong, but we don\u2019t want to hear that we\u2019re wrong."}]], "Is hypnosis covered by insurance?": [[{"subtitle": "Is hypnosis covered by insurance?", "paragraph": "Is hypnosis covered by insurance? No, because it is considered a psychotherapeutic service, and insurance companies usually exclude those services. For instance, Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHC) does not cover hypnosis. Most states require their insurance companies to cover a portion of the cost, but the insurance company can cover a portion of the cost for out-of-network services (in case you are treated by a doctor or therapist you have not met before). In order for hypnosis to be covered by your insurance company, the hypnosis must be used for therapeutic purposes. This is called \"psychotherapy.\" \"Psychiatry\" and \"psychotherapy\" are both considered psychotherapeutic practices."}, {"subtitle": "Hypnosis: The Birth of the Rorschach Test", "paragraph": "I\u2019ve always been fascinated with hypnosis because it has intrigued me since I was a kid. Hypnosis has its roots in the 1960\u2019s, when Hermann Rorschach founded the Rorschach Test which was a detailed psychological assessment administered by completing inkblots in the face of the patient. This in turn was followed by a popular book called the \u201cThematic Apperception Test\u201d or TAT."}, {"subtitle": "Hypernosis and the Hollywood Boom", "paragraph": "In the 1970\u2019s, another trend set in motion that brought hypnosis into the mainstream. This occurred when John Woo, the director of \u201cThe Killer\u201d hit the movie market. John Woo used hypnosis techniques to induce trauma for his actors so they could learn how to more effectively handle the on-screen violence. In the United States, the trend was met with resistance in some circles, though there were many who were open to exploring the techniques."}, {"subtitle": "Greeks and Hippocratic Oaths", "paragraph": "It is generally accepted that the practice of hypnosis was passed down to us by the Greeks. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, was said to have had training in hypnosis when he was asked by his students to put them in a hypnotic state. He is said to have \u201csold\u201d his patients to the masses. Hypnosis was used to heal and there are plenty of records showing that hypnosis was used for medical purposes. The Hippocratic Oath, which the physicians of the day signed off on, mentioned that hypnosis could be used to treat fever and acute pain."}], [{"subtitle": "Certification of Hypnotherapists", "paragraph": "The certification process for hypnotherapists has changed quite a bit in the past decade. The few programs that are still recognized by the NASH are very good. Most of the programs for the past decade, however, have been passed off as \"self hypnosis\" sessions where you are told how to do it by following the steps in a given book. The reviews on the internet of these programs are not always favorable, although some have had long term results. Remember this point, the more hours it takes to become certified the more likely you will be on the safe side."}, {"subtitle": "Hypnotic Sessions in a Sanctuary or an Ecclesiastical Setting?", "paragraph": "You might also ask: \"Is this procedure done in a'sanctuary' or an 'ecclesiastical' setting? Often hypnosis is done in a sanctuary. You are in a darkened room with no distractions, and you can ask questions of the therapist at any time if you need more information. In contrast, a hypnotic session done in a \"church,\" a \"synagogue,\" or a \"temple\" where you are among hundreds of other people may be harder to control, and it may be quite difficult for you to speak up if you need more information. You may prefer the latter type of session for some reason."}, {"subtitle": "Hypnosis for the general population", "paragraph": "Although most of the testimonials you will read on this website and in many of the hypnosis books written by well respected authors, you will find some excellent discussions of people who have had a very negative experience in hypnosis.
